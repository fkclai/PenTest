## Web Application PenTest


### Web Application

Information Gathering/Information Leakage

·         Identify the product information with latest version

·         Outdated components or  known vulnerability (CVE) found in the identified product

·         Access to the default URL or admin page of the identified product

·         Any opening port other than 80 and 443

·         Any sensitive data find in the website

### Encryption

·         HTTPS enabled and only TLS 1.2 or above available

·         Correctness of the certification information

·         SSL Certificate strength, at least > 2048 bits

·         Weak Ciphers are supported

### Authentication

·         Only use Post HTTP method to transfer the login data

·         Possible to change the valid session with other user id during the login process

·         Browser back to resend the login

·         Possible to identify user id from the application respond/behavior

·         Cached in session key or cookie with login information / sensitive data

·         Default / guessable login credentials used

·         Implemented effective logout mechanism, e.g. invalidate the session and login required

·         Implemented session timeout, e.g. max of 1 hour if no business requirement.

·         Implemented CAPTCHA or other brute force attack prevention mechanism

·         Implemented account locking mechanism

·         Does not allow multiple login

### Password Management

·         What is the password policy

·         Allow change password

·         Implemented maximal length of password

·         Vulnerable on the reset password process

 

### Session / Cookie Management

·         Session Id stored in cookie only

·         Vulnerable to the Session fixation or CSRF attack

·         Session Id change after login

·         Session Id guessable

·         Cookie session lifetime setting, expired when browser is closed

·         Restricted the cookie access within the same domain, HTTP Only and secure flag enable

### Authorization

·         Possible to obtain higher level function access

·         Possible to obtain other user’s data

·         Is the site structure guessable and accessible

·         Vulnerable to Path Traversal attack

 

### Data Validation

·         Input data are parsed or encoded for output

·         Implemented the server side parsing mechanism

·         Vulnerable to Injection of

o   XSS (included: Reflected, Stored and DOM Based )

o   SQL (included: Error, Union, Boolean and time base)

o   XPath

o   XML

o   Command

o   LDAP

·         SSRF

 

### Web Service API

·         Guessable of the API service call

·         Authentication required

·         Authorization implemented

·         All input validate in server side

·         All input / output data format is defined with validation control

 

### Others check

·         Clickjacking

·         Frame Tampering

·         Invalidated redirects and forwards

·         Secure HTTP Respond Header setting

·         Error handling
